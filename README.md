# [Project 1: Bank Note Authentication End to End with Dockers](https://github.com/harishkumar-295/Bank-note-Authentication-end-to-end-implementation-with-docker)
1. Used RandomForestClassifier to predict whether the note is authentic or not as problem is not, fitted the data and created pickle file to save the model .
2. Used Flask to create web API.
3. Deployed the model using Flask and Flasgger.
4. Deployed the model using Docker and Flask.
5. Deployed the model using Streamlit.
